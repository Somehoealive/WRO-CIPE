WRO robot  :D

Our robot is 3D printed wirh open source desin in tingiverse. The robot uses arduino uno to controll everithing.
A servo motor is used to controll the front wehles in turning, we have picked it because its cheap and eficient to change for a new one
if it breaks also servos small size fits betveen the front part of the robotframe so it cud turn the wehls.
For wehles in the back we use a 12V DC motor , because of its small size and speed.
We wierd it to use a 9v batery for arduinouno and servo motor, and a baterybank for the 12V DC motor.

The programm for the reare weehls is with the mane of "SÃµit" and it informs the motor throuh... to set a sertain speed of 100 for 2 sekonds.
The programm to turn the servo is called "Servo" and it sets it movment to turn one way and then a nother(first ricght then left).
The combination of them with the buttun to start the programm is under the name WRO2
WRO 1 was the programm for the trial round we had in estonia but so i cud fod it easyly i just named it WRO1.
IN WRO2 the motors dont start untill the pressing of the buton (conrcted to...) and then the servo turns right for 20 millisekonds and
after that rides forward then stops, folowing that it turns back its front wheles in 20 millisekond and reapets the drive forward and stop motion.
The reson why we dont ride and turn during the same time is because if the robot rides the servo isnt strong enouth to turn during the same time.

Picktuers of the robots original design are all the fotos with .jpgand the 3D moduel for printing is under "AUTO".
The latest wersion of the robot is Picktures ... and its a modofied wersion off he original print where we had to sole the problem of it holding itself together
and wheles not falling off with screwes. And
