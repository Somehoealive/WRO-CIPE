WRO robot  :D

Our robot is 3D printed wirh open source desin in tingiverse. The robot uses arduino uno to controll everithing.
A servo motor is used to controll the front wehles in turning, we have picked it because its cheap and eficient to change for a new one if it breaks also its small size fits snugly into the robotframe.
For wehles in the back we use a 12V DC motor , because of its small size and speed.
We wierd it to use a 9v batery for arduinouno and servo motor, and a baterybank for the 12V DC motor.

The programm for the reare weehls is with the mane of... and it informs the motor throuh... to set a sertain speed of...
The programm to turn the servo is ... and it sets it movment to turn one way and thenna nother.
The combination of them with the buttun to start the programm is under the name...
There the motors dont start untill the pressin of the buton (conrcted to...) and then the servo turns right for... and after that turns back.
